# Assignment 3 – Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains the solutions to **Assignment 3** of the Python course - **Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**.

## 📚 Assignment Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Description**:  
A Python script that:
1. Defines a recursive function `factorial()` which takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial using recursion.
3. Returns the result and prints it by calling the function with a sample number.

**Example**:
```

Input: 5
Output: Result of the inserted number is: 120

````

**How to Run**:
```bash
python Task1.py
````

### ✅ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Description**:
A Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Calculates:

   * The square root using `math.sqrt()`
   * The natural logarithm using `math.log()`
   * The sine (in radians) using `math.sin()`
3. Displays all calculated results.

**Example**:

```
Input: 25  
Output:
Given number: 25.0
Square root: 5.0
Natural log (ln): 3.2188758248682006
Sine (in radians): -0.13235175009777303
```

**How to Run**:

```bash
python Task2.py
```
