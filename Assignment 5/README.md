# Assignment 5 – Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains the solutions to **Assignment 5** of the Python course - **Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python**.

## 📚 Assignment Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

**Description**:  
A Python program that:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2. Asks the user to input a student's name.
3. Retrieves and displays the student's marks if the name exists.
4. Displays a custom message if the student is not found.

**Example**:
```

Input: Sam
Output: Sam got 29 marks in exam.

Input: John
Output: Student(John) not found.

````

**How to Run**:
```bash
python Task1.py

### ✅ Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

**Description**:
A Python program that:

1. Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3. Reverses the extracted elements.
4. Prints both the original list and the manipulated list.

**Example Output**:

```
Original List:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
Extracted List:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Reverse Extracted List:  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**How to Run**:

```bash
python Task2.py
```
