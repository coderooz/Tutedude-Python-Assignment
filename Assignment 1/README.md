# 📘 Tutedude Assignment 1 – Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains solutions to **Assignment 1** of the Tutedude Python course, **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**. The assignment consists of two tasks:

- **Task 1:** Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
- **Task 2:** Create a Personalized Greeting

---

## 🧮 Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### ✅ Objective
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes **two numbers** as input from the user.
2. Performs the following operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the result of each operation.

### 📄 File: `Task1.py`

#### 💻 Sample Functionality:
```python
Enter any number 1: 10
Enter any number 2: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Divition: 2.0
````

The program uses separate functions (`addNum`, `subNum`, `mulNum`, and `divNum`) for modular and reusable arithmetic logic.

## 🙋‍♂️ Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### ✅ Objective

Write a Python program that:

1. Takes a user's **first name** and **last name** as input.
2. Combines them into a full name.
3. Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.

### 📄 File: `Task2.py`

#### 💻 Sample Functionality:

```python
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Greetings! John Doe.
```

The script defines a function `greatingCode(first, last)` to format the greeting message.
