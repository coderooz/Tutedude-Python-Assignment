# Assignment 6 – Calculator using Tkinter

This repository contains a Python GUI calculator project built using the `tkinter` module, as part of **Module 10 & 11: GUI Programming in Python**.

---

## 📚 Objective

Build a basic calculator application using **Tkinter** that supports:
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Decimal inputs
- Clear (`C`) and Backspace (`←`) functionality
- Result evaluation (`=`)

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Responsive button-based interface using Tkinter Grid Layout
- Input and result displayed in an Entry widget
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Object-oriented design with a `Calculator` class
