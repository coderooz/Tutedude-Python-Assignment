The sun descends, a fiery, fading grace,
Casting long shadows on the fading day,
While twilight whispers softly, in its place,
And birdsong fades, as darkness holds its sway.
The stars emerge, a glimmer in the blue,
A gentle breeze begins to softly sigh,
The world is hushed, its daily tasks subdue,
As silent night begins to drift on by.
A peaceful calm descends upon the land,
And quiet reigns, where once was bustling sound,
A comforting hand, within this silent band,
As sleep descends, on hallowed, sacred ground.
The moon ascends, a silver, watchful eye,
A gentle lullaby, before we fly.
