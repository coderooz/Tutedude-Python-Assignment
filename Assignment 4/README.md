# Assignment 4 – Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains the solutions to **Assignment 4** of the Python course - **Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python**.

## 📚 Assignment Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

**Description**:  
A Python program that:
1. Opens and reads the content of a file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints each line of the file with line numbers.
3. Handles file-related errors gracefully using `try-except`.

**Example Output** (if file exists):
```

Line 1: Hello world
Line 2: This is a test file.

```

**Example Output** (if file not found):
```

Error: File not found or error in opening the file.

````

**How to Run**:
```bash
python Task1.py
````

> 📁 Make sure a file named `sample.txt` exists in the same directory for successful execution.

### ✅ Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

**Description**:
A Python script that:

1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Takes another user input and appends it to the same file.
3. Finally reads and displays the entire content of `output.txt`.

**Example**:

```
Enter Few words for the file: Hello
Enter some more words into the file: World!
File(output.txt) content: HelloWorld!
```

**How to Run**:

```bash
python Task2.py
```
